## Code Review Practice: `merge_sorted_lists`

This repository documents a code review practice exercise focused on a simple Python function, `merge_sorted_lists`. The goal of this exercise was to simulate the roles of both a Pull Request (PR) creator and a PR reviewer to understand the benefits and workflow of a collaborative code review process.

## Functionality

The `merge_sorted_lists` function takes two sorted lists as input and merges them into a single sorted list. It includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure correctness.

## Workflow

The following steps were performed as part of this code review practice:

1.  **PR Creator (Initial Implementation):**
    *   Created a `merge_sort.py` file containing the initial `merge_sorted_lists` function and unit tests.
    *   Created a new branch (`feature/merge-sorted-lists`).
    *   Committed and pushed the initial code to the branch.
    *   Created a pull request (PR) on GitHub.

2.  **PR Reviewer (Simulated Review):**
    *   Reviewed the code in the PR, focusing on:
        *   Code readability
        *   Potential improvements
        *   Test case correctness
    *   Added comments directly to the PR on GitHub, suggesting:
        *   Adding a docstring to the function
        *   Renaming the parameter variables for clarity
        *   Correcting an error in the `test_identical_lists` test case
        *   (Note:  The suggestion to use `heapq.merge` was intentionally skipped for this exercise.)

3.  **PR Creator (Revision):**
    *   Addressed the feedback from the code review.
    *   Implemented the suggested changes:
        *   Added a docstring to the `merge_sorted_lists` function.
        *   Renamed the parameter variables to `sorted_list1` and `sorted_list2`.
        *   Corrected the `test_identical_lists` test case.
    *   Committed and pushed the revised code to the branch.
    *   Updated the PR description to reflect the changes.

4.  **PR Reviewer (Final Review - Simulated):**
    *   Re-reviewed the revised code.
    *   Confirmed that all feedback had been addressed.
    *   Approved the pull request.

5.  **Completion:**
    *   The pull request was merged into the main branch.
    *   The feature branch was deleted.

## Files

*   `merge_sort.py`: Contains the `merge_sorted_lists` function and its unit tests.

## Lessons Learned

*   The importance of clear and descriptive code.
*   The value of comprehensive unit tests.
*   The benefits of code review for identifying potential improvements and errors.
*   The importance of clear communication and collaboration during the code review process.
*   The iterative nature of code development through review and revision.

## Note

This exercise was a simulation of a code review process. In a real-world scenario, the PR creator and reviewer would typically be different people, fostering a more diverse perspective and potentially leading to more robust code improvements.
